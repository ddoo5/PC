# How it works?
```Password creator``` keeps your security by generating complex passwords. It can generate five types of passwords:
-	Ordinary password consists of 6 chars: uppercase and lowercase letters
-	Password with numbers consist of 8 chars: numbers and both types of letters
-	Password with symbols consist of 8 chars: special symbols (-'^*~@/!#$%&) and both types of letters
-	Complex password consists of 16 chars: numbers, special symbols and both types of letters
-	Random password consists of 6-30 chars: numbers, special symbols and both types of letters
If password is similar to Kxxxxxw, you should change it.
